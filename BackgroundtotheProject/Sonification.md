To begin the process, we returned to the Excel spreadsheet where the research team was tracking the framing of data breaches as crises through the language and expressions used to describe the victims, perpetrators, the breach, and the company or organized implicated in the incident. To do this we assessed each category separately to devise a scoring framework.
