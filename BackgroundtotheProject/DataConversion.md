# Data Conversion

Once we had a scoring framework in place, we followed it to code the data in the Excel spreadsheet. This Case Conversion file documents how language and expressions were converted into numerical values using the scoring framework.  

We then removed the discourse analysis data from the spreadsheet, keeping only the numerical values. The result was the Data Breaches Sonification Data spreadsheet used to create the sonifications in TwoTone.
