# Methods
As mentioned previously, the data sonifications stem from a larger project that examines the construction of data breaches as crises from 2005 to the present. The year 2005 was chosen because it marks the transition from using "virus" to "breach" to describe cybersecurity threats, reflecting both technological and linguistic shifts. Additionally, 2005 was just before the widespread adoption of smartphones, with Apple introducing the iPhone in 2007 and 1 billion smartphones in use by 2012. Studying data breaches over this period highlights the shift from desktop computing to pervasive cloud computing and data collection (see: Zeffiro et al., 2023)
