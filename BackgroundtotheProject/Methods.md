# Methods
As mentioned previously, the data sonifications stem from a larger project that examines the construction of data breaches as crises from 2005 to the present. The year 2005 was chosen because it marks the transition from using "virus" to "breach" to describe cybersecurity threats, reflecting both technological and linguistic shifts. Additionally, 2005 was just before the widespread adoption of smartphones, with Apple introducing the iPhone in 2007 and 1 billion smartphones in use by 2012. Studying data breaches over this period highlights the shift from desktop computing to pervasive cloud computing and data collection (see: Zeffiro et al., 2023) 

## Data Collection 

We examined 16 data breach cases in total from 2005-2021. As we observed, in cases in the early years, it was often challenging to assess the geopolitical significance of data breaches, as these events were not yet ascribed to the same level of significance as they are today. Consequently, we selected high-profile data breach cases that received extensive coverage, which helped shape the discourse around data breaches. For example, our analysis reveals that in 2007, data breaches were viewed as inevitable consequences of technological progress, unlike contemporary sources that focus on identifying the causes or malicious actors behind breaches. This framing of technoscientific progress as inevitable is noteworthy because, in later years, data breaches are seen as abnormal or exceptional. We understand this shift as a normalizing discourse of the data breach as security crises (see: Zeffiro et al., 2023) 

Our sample includes primary sources from a variety of publications, gathered using the Dow Jones search engine Factiva. Factiva, though primarily a business news database, offers extensive global coverage of newspapers, trade journals, blogs, and websites, making it ideal for our study on data breaches. We developed a framework for identifying key terms and phrases, using search terms (like "MyFitnessPal" AND "data breach") for specific case studies. We limited our searches to the year of the public release of information about a data breach and examined the five most frequently publishing sources for each case in that year. Our sources often included major publications such as the Associated Press, BBC, and The New York Times, and we also incorporated relevant international and local news sources as needed. We filtered each publication’s results by relevance, ensuring the articles were primarily about the given case, contained sufficient information for analysis, and were not republished from other sources. We collected approximately 10 articles from each source that met these criteria, resulting in a total of 288 primary sources across 26 cases (see: Zeffiro et al., 2023) 

## Critical Discourse Analysis 

We employed critical discourse analysis to examine the primary sources, focusing on words and phrases with ideological associations and metaphorical content in framing security crises (Gill 2000). This method allowed us to identify the values, beliefs, and assumptions communicated within and across the cases. Our aim with discourse analysis was to understand the “creation and composition” of data breaches as security crises (Liebetrau & Christensen 2021) and how the framing of data breaches in this way connects to the social, political and historical contexts in which these events circulate (see: Zeffiro et al. 2023) 

Using discourse analysis, the research team employed a two-fold approach to data collection and analysis. First, for each data breach case, we created summaries for each primary source and developed a higher-level narrative for each case, noting the descriptions and metaphors used to characterize perpetrators, breach framing, perceived risk, victims, and data. Second, we entered these observations into an Excel spreadsheet, tracking the language and expressions used to describe the victims, perpetrators, breach, data compromised, and crisis framing (see: Zeffiro et al., 2023). 

The analysis focused on how news media construe data breaches as crises. However, we did not aim to define data breaches solely through these representations or track discursive changes over time. Instead, we understand these security crisis discourses as examples of what Michel Foucault (1972, 1978) described as “normalizing discourses.” In short, we traced the factors that contributed to framing a data breach as a security crisis. In short, our research reveals how the production, negotiation, and management of data breaches as security crises emerge from a cultural matrix of meaning (Helmreich 2000, 474; see: Zeffiro et al. 2023) 

## Sonification 

To sonify the data derived from the discourse analysis, we had to convert the words into numbers. To begin the process, we returned to the Excel spreadsheet where the research team was tracking the framing of data breaches as crises through the language and expressions used to describe the victims, perpetrators, the breach, and the company or organized implicated in the incident. To do this we assessed each category separately to devise a scoring framework.  

## Scoring Framework 

We came up with this Scoring Framework informed by the insights generated through the discourse analysis. 

<b> Perpetrators </b> refers to the intensity of language used to describe the individuals or entities deemed responsible for the data breach. Based on our research, we found that language ranged in intensity, with the use of the word ‘hacker’ evolving over time to be applied as shorthand to describe the breach as unauthorized and compromising. 

- 0	Unknown 
- 1	Neutral language  
- 2	Demonstrates Intent (fraudster, fisher) 
- 3	HACKER (clear cut, trope) 
- 4	More criminal intent than the more generalized use of hacker 
- 5	Larger nefarious criminality, more organized, identified group or individual 

<b> Company </b> tracks whether a company was named or not. Because all the breaches we studied impacted mid-to-large size organizations, it was important for us to track when and how companies or organizations were named explicitly in sources. We chose to score when a company was named as a 2 knowing this would produce a sound with a higher pitch and render more audible those infrequent instances when an entity was named. 

<b> Company (named or not) </b> 

- 1 Not named (No) 
- 2	Named (Yes) 

<b> Breach </b> reflects the intensity of the language and expressions used to describe the data breach event. We observed how in the mid to late aughts, language was more passive and used inconsistently to describe the event. As breach discourses stabilized in later years, we noticed how the language used to describe the breach corresponded to its size or the sensitivity of the data. For large breaches or those involving sensitive data, the language used to describe the breach scored higher on the scale.  

<b> Breach (intensity of the language used to describe the breach) </b>

- 0	Unknown 
- 1	Passive language (exposed, unprotected, revealed) 
- 2	Leaking (accessed directly) 
- 3	Breach 
- 4	Major breach 
- 5	Catastrophe 

<b> Data </b> represents the sensitivity of data compromised in a data breach. We devised the following scale to account for what we observed as the ways sensitivity was observed in the discourse analysis. We wanted to understand how sensitivity corresponded to other variables, like perpetrators and breach. 

<b> Data (sensitivity of data) </b>

- 0	Unknown 
- 1	Public already 
- 2	Sensitive 
- 3	Very sensitive 

<b> Risk </b> considers the language used to describe the risk to those impacted by the data breach, such as consumers who accounts were compromised. We consistently documented instances when the language used to describe the risk was intense even when the risk was still yet unknown, and in these instances, we scored these findings in the mid-range to account for the intensity of the language and expressions used. 

<b> Risk (The specific language used to describe the risk) </b>

- 0	Unknown 
- 1	Low Risk (describes a possible or projected risk; the data is already publicly available) 
- 2	Medium risk (a known risk is identified; language is intense, but the risk is unknown) 
- 3	High risk (immediate concern and impact; a concrete risk is named) 

<b> Risk to company </b> tracks whether a risk to the company was articulated or not. We felt this was important to discern in relation to other company data and the broader framing of the data breach as a security crisis. Similarly to the company named variable, we chose to score when the risk to a company was articulated as a 2 to produce a sound with a higher pitch and render more audible those instances when risk was ascribed to an organization. 

<b> Risk to Company </b>

- 1	No 
- 2	Yes 

Although <b> size </b> is not represented in the framework because it was already recorded numerically in the Excel spreadsheet, this variable was used in the sonification and represents the number of accounts compromised in each of the data breach cases. If a source did not reveal this information, we in-put a ‘0’ value into the spreadsheet. Remarkably, we encountered this with only one case, the Twitch breach in 2021. Unlike the reporting of all the other cases that revealed the number of accounts compromised, the focus of the Twitch case was on the amount of data (1000GB) leaked.  We were interested in tracking the size of the data breach to understand how size corresponded to the other variables. 

<b> Data Conversion </b>

Once we had a scoring framework in place, we followed it to code the data in the Excel spreadsheet. This Case Conversion file documents how language and expressions were converted into numerical values using the scoring framework.  

We then removed the discourse analysis data from the spreadsheet, keeping only the numerical values. The result was the Data Breaches Sonification Data spreadsheet used to create the sonifications in TwoTone.
