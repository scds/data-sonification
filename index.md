# Getting started with Sonifying Data.

Welcome, budding sound data enthusiast! If you're curious about collecting data to sonify or simply looking to enhance your research skills, you've come to the right place. Here, we'll introduce you to a study that delved into understanding international media discourses surrounding massive data breaches. Here we used sonification as a primary methodology in order to gain new understandings of the data we had collected. By the end of this guide, you should have a clear roadmap on how to embark on your own data collection and sonification journey. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to sonify your data.
