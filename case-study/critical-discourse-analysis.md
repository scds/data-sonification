# Critical Discourse Analysis
We used critical discourse analysis to examine the primary sources, focusing on words and phrases with ideological associations and metaphorical content in framing security crises. This method helped us identify the values, beliefs, and assumptions conveyed within and across the cases. Our goal was to understand the "creation and composition" of data breaches as security crises[^2] and how this framing is connected to the social, political, and historical contexts in which these events occur.[^3]

Using discourse analysis, the research team employed a two-fold approach to data collection and analysis. First, for each data breach case, we created summaries for each primary source and developed a higher-level narrative for each case, noting the descriptions and metaphors used to characterize perpetrators, breach framing, perceived risk, victims, and data. Second, we entered these observations into an Excel spreadsheet, tracking the language and expressions used to describe the victims, perpetrators, breach, data compromised, and crisis framing.[^3]

The research team used a two-step approach to data collection and analysis with discourse analysis. First, for each data breach case, we summarized each primary source and developed a comprehensive narrative, noting the descriptions and metaphors used for perpetrators, breach framing, perceived risk, victims, and data. Second, we recorded these observations in an Excel spreadsheet, tracking the language and expressions used to describe the victims, perpetrators, breach, compromised data, and crisis framing.[^3] [^6]
